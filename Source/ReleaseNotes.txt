Project site:     http://code.google.com/p/gdata-objectivec-client/
DIscussion group: http://groups.google.com/group/gdata-objectivec-client-framework


Release 1.3.0
Changes since 1.2.0

Additions

- Added kGDataLinkRelWebContent (thanks riggle)

- Calendar events now have separate methods for recurrence and non-recurrence
  reminders, and calling setRecurrence will move the reminders appropriately
  
- Added batch support for Calendar and Spreadsheet. Calendar sample app now
  does batch delete of events when more than one event is selected.
  
- Added syncEvent, sequenceNumber, and iCalUID to Calendar event entries.

- Added spreadsheet worksheet methods for setting row and column limits,
  and default values for those in new spreadsheets.
  
- GDataService classes can now optionally follow "next" links when retrieving
  feeds.  This must be enabled by calling setServiceShouldFollowNextLinks:
  on the service object.
  
- GDataHTTPFetcher and services now optionally automatically retry fetches of
  some errors.  Calling setIsServiceRetryEnabled: enables the retry behavior
  for services.
  
- Feeds and entries now have methods for adding categories.

- GDataCategory includes label convenience method categoryWithLabel: and
  utility categories on arrays, containsCategoryWithLabel: and categoryLabels.
  GDataCategory's isEqual: now compares label data as well.
  
- Docs sample app can now delete a document.

- Picasa Web sample app now shows how to move a photo to another album.

- Added MacOSX version to service request user agent, along with a gzip string
  expected in the user agent by Google servers.

  
Bugs Fixed

- Framework is now built with install location of @loader_path/../Frameworks...
  instead of @executable_path/../Frameworks/... so it can be loaded by other
  bundles such as plug-ins.
  
- A specific format is now specified in the header for calling setUserAgent: 
  (like [service setUserAgent:@"CompanyName-AppName-1.0"])
  The library now will append the client library version to the user agent
  string.
  
- GDataObject's isEqual: no longer compares local element names
  
- Fixed PicasaWeb feed URL parameter escaping.

- Fixed GDataCategory's categoriesWithScheme: category on NSArray.

- Now removes null characters from strings added to XML elements to avoid
  XML that makes servers unhappy.
  
- Feed, entry, and service classes now call their own methods more reliably
  to aid subclassing.
  
- Text constructs no longer specify "type=text" since that is implied according
  to the Atom standard.
  
- Service unit tests now cover http cookies and caching.

- HTTP cookies now work with server at localhost.

- Now defining -hash on GDataObject for better Leopard compatibility.

  easily attach any data without subclassing
  
- The ticket now retains the posted object for the convenience of the callbacks

Bugs Fixed

  as the author is always the authenticated user
  
- Removed method for retrieving a calendar event feed for a username

- Changed addReminders: to addReminder: (thanks riggle)

- Return proper numeric types in GDataValueConstruct methods (thanks riggle)

- Fixed bugs in finding the proper class to instantiate from a category in XML

- Store cookies on redirects (thanks riggle)

- Fixed extra retain on arguments during pre-authenticated fetches

- Allow subclasses of GDataEntryPhoto to override photoData method

- Ensure default application identifier is valid for an http useragent

- When a service is asked to retrieve a feed and actually fetches an entry,
  the service no longer creates a feed to contain the entry, so clients must
  be explicit about whether a feed or an entry is expected

  (thanks ghulands)

4-June-2007
Changes since 1.0.0

- Added ACL feed support, and ACL display and editing in Calendar sample
  
- GDataAtomPubControl convenience creator adds the "app" namespace for the
  element
  
- Fixed some incorrect selector signatures in the Blogger sample
