This sample calls the GData Cocoa Touch support for OAuth. (iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad.)

This sample uses a UINavigationController in its main view.

If your application's main view doesn't use UINavigationController, consider using your UIViewController's presentModalViewController: to push a new cover view that is a UINavigationController.
